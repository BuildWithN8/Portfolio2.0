## üîê Step 1: Set Up Google reCAPTCHA

### 1.1 Create reCAPTCHA Project
1. Go to [Google reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create"** to add a new site

### 1.2 Configure reCAPTCHA Settings
1. **Label**: Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Nathan's Portfolio Contact Form")
2. **reCAPTCHA type**: Select **"reCAPTCHA v2"** ‚Üí **"I'm not a robot" Checkbox**
3. **Domains**: Add your domains:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `nathansportfolio.vercel.app` (or your actual domain)
   - `*.vercel.app` (for Vercel preview deployments)
4. **Accept Terms of Service**
5. Click **"Submit"**

### 1.3 Get Your Keys
After creation, you'll see:
- **Site Key** (starts with `6L...`) - This goes in `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`
- **Secret Key** (starts with `6L...`) - This goes in `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`

### 1.4 Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env.local` file:
```env
# Replace with your actual keys from Google reCAPTCHA
NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=6Lxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=6Lxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## üìß Step 2: Set Up Resend Email Service

### 2.1 Create Resend Account
1. Go to [Resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### 2.2 Get API Key
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **"API Keys"**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Name it (e.g., "Portfolio Contact Form")
4. Select **"Sending access"** permission
5. Copy the API key (starts with `re_...`)

### 2.3 Configure Sending Domain (Optional but Recommended)
**Option A: Use your own domain**
1. In Resend dashboard, go to **"Domains"**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `yourdomain.com`)
4. Follow DNS setup instructions
5. Wait for verification (can take up to 72 hours)

**Option B: Use Resend's shared domain (Quick Start)**
- You can skip domain setup and use Resend's shared domain
- Emails will come from `noreply@trial.example.com` format
- This works immediately but looks less professional

### 2.4 Update Environment Variables
Update your `.env.local` file:
```env
# Resend API Key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Email Configuration
CONTACT_EMAIL_TO=nathancwatkins@gmail.com
CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM=contact@yourdomain.com  # Or use resend's shared domain
```

## üöÄ Step 3: Deploy to Production

### 3.1 Update Production Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
   RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   CONTACT_EMAIL_TO=nathancwatkins@gmail.com
   CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM=contact@yourdomain.com
   ```
4. Make sure to set them for **Production**, **Preview**, and **Development** environments

### 3.2 Deploy Changes
1. Push your code to GitHub (already done ‚úÖ)
2. Vercel will automatically deploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## üß™ Step 4: Test the Contact Form

### 4.1 Local Testing
1. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/#contact`
3. Fill out the form with test data
4. Complete reCAPTCHA
5. Submit form
6. Check for:
   - Success message appears
   - Email received at `nathancwatkins@gmail.com`
   - Auto-reply sent to test email

### 4.2 Production Testing
1. Go to your live site
2. Scroll to contact section
3. Submit a test form
4. Verify emails are sent correctly

### 4.3 Security Testing
Test that security measures work:
1. Try submitting form without reCAPTCHA (should fail)
2. Try submitting multiple forms quickly (should hit rate limit)
3. Try submitting with empty fields (should show validation errors)

## üõ† Step 5: Optional Enhancements

### 5.1 Custom Domain Email Setup
If you want emails from your own domain:
1. Complete Resend domain verification (Step 2.3)
2. Update `CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM` to use your domain
3. Test email delivery

### 5.2 Enhanced Analytics
The form already tracks these events:
- `contact_form_view` - Form becomes visible
- `contact_form_field_focus` - User focuses on field
- `contact_form_submit_attempt` - User clicks submit
- `contact_form_submit_success` - Successful submission
- `contact_form_submit_error` - Failed submission
- `contact_form_recaptcha_complete` - reCAPTCHA completed

Monitor these in your Google Analytics dashboard.

### 5.3 Email Template Customization
To customize email templates, edit:
- `lib/email/templates.ts` - Modify HTML/text templates
- Redeploy after changes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. reCAPTCHA not loading:**
