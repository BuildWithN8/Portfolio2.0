# Pin Notes

## Footer Grid Investigation
- `footer-grid.svg` is referenced in Footer.tsx but may not be visible due to positioning
- Located at: `components/Footer.tsx:14`
- CSS positioning: `absolute left-0 1sm:-translate-y-52 -bottom-72 min-h-96 opacity-50`
- Hero section uses CSS-based grid (Tailwind classes) instead of SVG
- **Action needed**: Investigate if footer grid is actually visible or if it should be removed/repositioned
- **Consideration**: Move to bento folder or remove entirely if not functional
